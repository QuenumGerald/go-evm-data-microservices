# EVM Wallet Monitor

This program monitors transactions involving a specified wallet address on an EVM-based blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain). It connects to a node, subscribes to new blocks, and checks for transactions involving the specified wallet address.

## Dependencies

- `context`: Defines the `Context` package, which carries deadlines, cancellations, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.
- `fmt`: Implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.
- `log`: Implements a simple logging package for diagnostic messages.
- `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common`: Provides common Ethereum types and helper functions.
- `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/core/types`: Contains data type definitions for blocks and transactions.
- `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient`: Provides an interface for interacting with an Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain node via JSON-RPC.
- `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc`: Provides a client for interacting with a JSON-RPC server.

## Main Function

The `main()` function performs the following steps:

1. Connects to the EVM-based blockchain node using the WebSocket URL.
2. Creates a new EthClient from the RPC client.
3. Subscribes to new block headers using `ethClient.SubscribeNewHead()`.
4. For each new block header, fetches the full block using `ethClient.BlockByHash()`.
5. Iterates through the transactions in the block and checks if the specified wallet address is involved.
6. If the wallet address is involved, prints the transaction details.

## Running the Program

To run this program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your computer. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Save the code in a file called `WalletMonitor.go`.
3. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the `WalletMonitor.go` file is located, and run the following command:go run WalletMonitor.go
4. The program will start monitoring transactions involving the specified wallet address on the EVM-based blockchain.

## Possible Improvements

### Filter Transactions by Amount
You can add a condition to filter transactions whose amount is greater or less than a certain value. Add a condition after retrieving the token transfer information in the `processBlock()` function:

### Monitor Multiple Addresses
To monitor multiple addresses, create an array of Ethereum addresses to monitor and modify the `processBlock()` function to check if the transaction sender or recipient is part of that array.

### Record Transactions to a File or Database
Save the information to a file or a database for later analysis. You can use standard Go packages to write to a file or connect to a database like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

### Add Notifications
Add email, SMS, or other notifications to be informed in real-time when a transaction involving the monitored address is detected. Use third-party services like SendGrid, Twilio, or Firebase Cloud Messaging to send notifications.

### Monitor Incoming and Outgoing Transactions Separately
If you want to monitor only incoming or outgoing transactions, you can modify the `processBlock()` function to check if the monitored address is the sender or recipient of the transaction and act accordingly.

### Error Handling and Automatic Reconnection
The current code does not handle errors robustly and does not automatically reconnect to the Ethereum node in case of disconnection. You can add reconnection logic and appropriate error handling to improve the program's stability.

### Monitor Other Types of Transactions
The current code focuses on ERC20 token transfers. You can extend the program to monitor other types of transactions, such as native Ether transfers, interactions with smart contracts, or ERC721 (non-fungible) token transfers.

### Performance Optimization
The current code processes each block individually and checks transactions sequentially. To improve performance, consider using goroutines and channels to process multiple blocks in parallel and reduce processing time.
